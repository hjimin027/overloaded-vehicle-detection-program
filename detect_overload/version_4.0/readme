In this version, we fixed two errors that occurred in version 3.5.  

1. In the process of saving the resulting image  
   we modified the perform_inference function to perform_inference_on_folder.  
   it takes a folder path as a parameter and performs inference on all image files in the folder.
   We also modified the code to pick 5 random images from the folder and visualize them.  

2. In File Import  
   The result_overload variable is a list, so the os.listdir() method cannot be used.  
   so we modified the code to read the paths (images) in the list after checking that the variable is a list.
