[cautions]
we have to download the pth file. 
i couldn't upload it because of the size.


[the main model algorithms]
these are the files about text extraction from png image files.
we need to prepare test data as a set of "png" files
and have to train the model with car index.
(but i think it's unnneccessary because this model is quite accurate.)
this model's result is the list about the image
 e.g. [([[189, 75], [469, 75], [469, 165], [189, 165]], '愚园路', 0.3754989504814148),
 ([[86, 80], [134, 80], [134, 128], [86, 128]], '西', 0.40452659130096436),
 ([[517, 81], [565, 81], [565, 123], [517, 123]], '东', 0.9989598989486694),
 ([[78, 126], [136, 126], [136, 156], [78, 156]], '315', 0.8125889301300049),]

=> bounding box,extracted text,accuracy
WE CAN HANDLE IT WITH INDEX
